            Located in the west district of Beijing, Million town is the first ever designed and built community socialhousing in the People’s republic of China in 1953. It once had the highest qualitied apartment units
            tailored to house intellectuals, with similar education level and family sizes selected by the government
            from different parts of the country, to come and resident in the capital city for work convenience.
            <br>
            This project served as a prototype of <b>communal living</b> that many neighborhoods residence followed to
            develop, creating residential blocks that had close neighborhood bonds.
            Nevertheless, as time passes, Million town is currently a near obsolete residential block, that the
            government considered to demolish and reform but decided to keep due to its historical value. Most
            residents are elders, renters from other cities and families with children attending the local primary
            school. The main issue is that the community lacks order and management. Waste, used furniture and
            building materials are dumped in public areas, some ground level residents even excavated the land for
            gardening. With no regulation privatizing the limited public space created safety hazards and disturbs
            the living of other residents.<br>

                During the beginning stage of the community transition to the IDEAL plan, drones will be sent out by
                UHAVE to first detect waste and occupied public zones, then scan the objects and finally
                upload information about these unwanted objects. (Clothes, furniture, garbage……)
                Residents will have the option to either give up these uploaded properties for the community to recycle
                and reuse or remove these objects from the public space and exchange it with other residents that has
                messaged.
