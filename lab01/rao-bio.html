        I major in Architecture, interested in green energy building and urban analysis. My passion in building system optimization motivated me to learn coding. Knowing that the conventional ways of designing by drawing and modeling in Rhino, sketch up and CAD is not efficient enough for the future where every industry is advancing in technology and becoming more “smart”, I dived into exploring computational design and using data for design analysis. I completed the IST256 course learning python and completed a small map visualization project on COVID data and CITI bike data for Jersey City . With this project I became an intern at an architectural firm doing façade modeling tool development using C# during the pandemic. Now as a graduating senior I am preparing to build my own websites for displaying my architectural projects and apply my illustration skills in web design using Adobe photoshop and illustrator. 
        Outside of work and school I enjoy doing cooking, photography and building Legos. My hometown never snows so skiing and snowboarding are two sports that I am learning after coming to Syracuse University.
