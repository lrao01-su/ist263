         <h1>Linjing Rao's Biography</h1>
         <img src="../images/bio-photo.png" alt="linjingphoto">
       
        <p>
            I major in <strong>Architecture</strong>, interested in green energy building and urban analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            My passion in building system optimization motivated me to learn coding. Knowing that the conventional ways of designing by drawing and modeling in Rhino, sketch up and CAD is not efficient enough for the future where every industry is advancing in technology and becoming more “smart”, I dived into exploring computational design and the application of data analysis in site analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Spring 2021 semester I completed the IST256 course learning python and made a visualization project displaying the COVID and CITI bike data sets on a map for the Jersey City. With this project I started to seek architectural jobs that require coding experience and eventually became an intern at an architectural firm doing façade modeling tool development using C# during the pandemic. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I am preparing to build my own websites for displaying my architectural projects.
